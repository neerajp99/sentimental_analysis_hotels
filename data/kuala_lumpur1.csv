No hairdryer and when asked, they confirmed they don’t have it at all. One towel for one person and you need to inform the reception every morning before you leave the property that you required the room to be made up, which wasn’t told me on my day of check-in. However they explained it was their policy which I wasn’t informed of. Almost no amenities in the room, other than bath and shower gel and a toilet roll. I must say, the room is very clean after it’s cleaned up on an everyday basis. I had a slightly scary experience as I took the lift to the 1st floor where my room was located and a man whom I assumed was a hotel guest who joined me inside the lift going up. He pressed “4” to supposedly get to his floor but he didn’t get off. Instead he got off the lift on the 1st floor after I did and walked behind me. I turned and looked behind me and when he turned into the first corridor (because he saw me looking behind me?), I almost ran for the next turning into a corridor and hurried into my room. It wasn’t a pleasant experience in this respect and it raised certain questions as to why he pressed for the “4th Floor” but walked out after I got off on the First Floor. I didn’t report this to the reception as I was leaving the next day. \n  \nWhen cleaned, the room was very clean. Wifi was very good.

You have to call the phone number (shown in the booking website) and tell them your story. It was very bad situation. Secondly, when get your key and access cad, you would have an access to your apartment level only. So, If you want to use any facilities (like swimming pool, kids play ground), you have to speak everytime to the security men for giving you an access. Furthermore, some of the facilities cannot be used such as (golf, fitness center) because they are out of service. The kids play ground was very bad and the kids swimming pool was cold.

I wore shoes the entire time coz the floors were dirty. The apartment is in a dire need of a good cleaning and some maintainence.

I would never recommend this to anyone!!\nAnd then there was the bad experience of check in + the check out (had specifically told them to be at the apartment at a specific time only for them to not show up). Far from the regular service apartment - this is basically a homestay (weirdly enough there’s signs everyone stating that it’s not for short term/home stay + the person who communicates with you via WhatsApp when you are about to arrive specifically asks you to NOT inform security that you are renting from booking.com etc. Made me super uncomfortable with this entire exchange.)\nGo to one of the hotels nearby - you’d pay the same rate and they’d be properly maintained.

Internet at the hotel sucks. We could not access internet on our laptops at all...why? Internet not secure! I believe your chain had an issue with hacked accounts? Technician wasnt helpful either suggesting “backdoor” access. Not professional or safe!  Helpful reception did their best but couldnt help either. Frustrating when we need to work remotely! Not up to 5 star standard at all. Service staff at breakfast need to be on task ( they improved after our first day) and see to guests needs, not cluster together and chat. 5 star hotel staff need to display what is expected- prompt, discreet service with a smile. Dishes were cleared only when we asked them to, but this got better on day 3&4. Only the check in staff and the chambermaid made my list of star service performers. Only 1 tissue box in the bathroom.. seriously? No counter top for us to work on either except a round l breakfast table in room. Insufficient toiletries provided n small touches like soap dish at bath tub & another set of toiletries there, soap dish in shower stall ( aside from one at sink ) liners for waste baskets ( I used plastic bags from my purchases!) would have been appreciated.\n  \nThe beds were comfy but the pillows smelt dank and were too soft and appeared overused ( gross stains- yuck!) breakfast spread was great but waffles nnpancakes were heavy n hard. Sambhar for idly was too sour tho. Lobby was spacious n beautiful and a good place to meet up and wait for transport etc. Our chambermaid was friendly and super efficient - floor 32 - and madesure we had enough of everything - appreciate her attention to detail.\nStayed in December 2018",5.8,Shahira,,,,,,,,,,,,

I’m surprised no one has yet complained about them. I have visited many Sheraton hotels around be globe and they always exceed my expectations, this honestly was the worst hotel experience I have experienced in my life. I would never recommend the Sheraton to my family nor my friends and co workers. Instead, I will actually discourage them about it.\n  \nThe only nice and helpful people from the staff were the bellhops.

K20,R50,"Reviewed: October 19, 2018","  \nI was very very disappointed in the communication gaps booking.com had with the tenants (agents). I communicated over two months back and got a confirmation about me and my friends getting a early checking and a late checkout. specially a early check in. and I even got a email from booking.com saying that the agent has approved and confirmed a early check-in with a welcome drink etc.. But the welcome we received was horrible and very unpleasant. The agent had no idea that we had a early check in and point blank refused to give us an apartment. after a lot of fuss they put us into a used/unclean apartment to rest and keep our bags. The apartment was smelling of smoke and non of us wanted to rest or even be in there, hence we went out to the mall. (so we arrived at the location at 7am and was taken to the dirty apartment at 9am) we had to sit out of the mall until it opened at 10am. and was there till until the agent gave the apartment at 1pm. This caused a huge delay in our plan as we were all tired traveling after work and been in the airports for over 5 hours etc, to come to the place we paid for and not get the service we expected, all we simply wanted was to settle down, have a shower, rest and get on with our plans.. but the start of the trip was crap and that messes all our plans and delayed the rest of the plans. I have always gone through booking.com from year 2009 but this was the worse experience I ever had to face.. They really lacked coordination... you all need to deliver what you promise your guests.. my friend had booked another apartment under a different agent and he had absolutely no issues.. If the property declined my request of a early check in I was planning to book a room from 6am to 2pm for me and my friends to freshen up and rest. unfortunately I couldn't do that cz I got a confirmation saying my request was approved..

The condition of the water kettle is seriously unacceptable.  The metal cord was rusty and we felt disgusted. We called for an assistance however the treatment that we received was opposite.  The agent (Not Local) was not happy upon arriving to our room. We showed him around and requested for a change to another room.  He was very reluctant to assist and kept passing remarks on us. ""If the next room same condition, we are not allow to change again"".  We felt threaten by his statement.  Without further delay, 3 of my friends followed him to the new room that was highly recommended by him to confirm on the condition esp the washroom doors. To our disappointment, the room was also not well maintain and the kettle condition is still the same condition as the previous room. We called for a replacement of the water kettle as we have given up on them.  FYI the bathtub was also not working well.  The water remains in the bathtub for 3 days. We used it to wash our legs only. There is alot of grievances during our stays.  Nevertheless, this suite is not highly recommended to stay and we will not be recommending any of our friends. They should do something about their room condition and their service render. This is totally different environment from my previous stays with Berjaya Times Sq Hotel.

There were a lot of tufts of matted hair belonging to the last guest or guests on the carpet and it kept getting stuck to my feet. Apart from that it's a solid hotel, but only a solid hotel- compared to other hotels in the city I've stayed I think it's incredibly overpriced. It seems to not be sure whether it is a family focused hotel or a design hotel, but it doesn't fit comfortably into either category. The price seems to reflect the idea of it being some kind of design hotel but the rooms just don't meet the mark and it works out a whole 100RM more expensive than other places in the city I've stayed, which were far more luxurious and comfortable. In fairness, being near the station bumps up the price a little, but still- I wouldn't choose it again over others in the city.\n  \nThe staff are all very well trained and go out of their way to help- especially the front desk and concierge staff.

K6,R2,"Reviewed: March 24, 2019","  \nCockroaches, filth, worn out. It was a nightmare. The host collected our money in cash the first night and said our room was temporary and he would switch us to another room the next day. We were skeptical but went with it anyway. The room was old, dirty, ragged, and showed signs of absolute stinginess. The next day we walk into the new room and there were cockroaches EVERYWHERE! We caught about 15 of them running around. It was horrifying. We called the host and asked him to switch us to another room. He said there were no rooms available. We ask for a refund and he refuses. When we insist he decides to show us two other rooms. The first one we walk into together and again there were tens of cockroaches just in front of the doorway. That's when he believes us. He takes us to another room, which thankfully had no cockroaches, but did have ants and smelled terrible. As we were tired and felt like there was no way to get our money back we decide to stay there. We couldn't wait until our time in KL ended so we could leave that place. Do not make our mistake and pay in advance, only pay for one night wherever you book until you're sure you want to stay there.

The wires were hanging out of the lamp on off button, the whole place needs a damn good scrub and a coat of paint. I had to use the hand shower over the bath as there was no way in hell I was going to get in that shower! It had a separate toilet room which stunk of urine and it never got cleaned once while I was there. I left little bits around the floors and carpets to see if they got cleaned, they didn't. From the photos on the booking page it looked an awesome place to stay, never again in this apartment! the location is brilliant and very central, but I would be too scared to book there again in case I got the same apartment! I even left a toaster I had purchased so I could have toast in the mornings, and also purchased cups, plates etc as there was no way I was going to use what was theirs. There was no safe in the room and the hair dryer was broken, the host said he would bring me one but never did, so had to get my hair washed and dried in the hairdressers in the shopping centre, over all very disappointed.

The property is the last building at your left. Is it called Frasier Residence and you will see in small letters 188 private suite. The “reception” is however one building earlier. So you need to go inside at the reception and you have to mention that you want to check-inn for 188 prive suites. As you may reed in other reviews these rooms are rented buy a few quick guys which are not Malay. As you have to drag your suitcase again at the next building the will bring you to their check-in area. This is a room messy room with blankets everywhere and quite messy. After handling the financials we were given one of the rooms. They said that we would get our room in the next hour at 15:00 hours. If will spare you the frustration but it became 18:30 hours. The rooms where quite dirty. If you were white socks  the became dirty in no time. There is no cleaning, no change of bedlinen and no change of your towel. Even the toilet paper is not provided. So the facilities and room on it’s own are great except the rest is not. There is no internet but that was mentioned at time of booking. If you put your chair at the door of the room you might pick up a free signal. If you would like to have some service, internet and nice people who actually can help you should book Frasier residence. But if you would like to go for the price and no service then I would recommend this accommodation. For us, if there is a next time, we will book Frasier.\n  \nThe room was very spacious. There is a swimming pool and  great fitness room with all modern equipment. The view of the fitness is great, because is it in the top floor. The metro is just 10 minutes away from the apartment.

The internet wasn’t working, theres hyppTv and an x90 tvbox, both didnt work either. The standard channels were blurry. The master bedroom AC wasn’t cooling so we kept the doors open and let the ac from the living in. Still warm, but it wasnt so bad. The safe was locked. Theres this emergency torchlight and it wasnt working the batteries inside already rusted. Not that we needed to use it but had it worked we’d be impressed. The frigde reeks like a dead animal so we opened a few tea bags and put them inside the fridge. Wasnt too bad after that. We noticed that some items were incomplete ie 3mugs, 2plates, etc. should be a set for 4 i suppose.. also, broken hand bidet, stuck sliding doors, desk lights not working. We were afraid they’d d accuse us of all these on check out, glad that didnt happen. But we took photos of everything when we first came in. Evidence. Hehe. The cafe at level 5 said we could call 0 for room service, except that there were no phone in the unit!!! We also got only one key and access card. They said we needed to request 3days prior if we need extras saying that they aleays go missing. Total BS. Thats what the deposit is for. My husband cld not stay in and do work while we went out shopping. The access card is RF and cuts off power when removed, and needed for lifts. Couldn’t even enjoy the facilities without dragging the entire family. The gym looks great wt yoga room but didnt get to use it because of the one key problem. Pool on level 5 water so cold even in the afternoon becsuse its totally shaded and windy. My 4yo daughter didnt want to go in. My 6yo only lasted 5mins. The jacuzzi wasnt working.

It looked inappropriate for a toilet finish, it was too rough and looks so dirty. As if you are taking a bath in a river.  The cleanliness of the toilet was terrible since you can see the floor not properly sweep nor wash. The toilet seat has some sticky thing on it which makes you think that the cleaning was not properly supervised and monitored. The toiletries was not enough. The light was very poor inside the toilet which adds to the gloomy atmosphere of the toilet. Maybe you can change the tiles of the toilet to the standard ceramic tiles which can easily be clean and disinfected and led lights to brigthen up the area.  The lobby was too dark and not so welcoming, the staff at the reception was not pleasant and did not consider our request for a quiet room.

It put us in a difficult situation, and one that could have easily been avoided if only we had been made aware of the extra expense when we checked in. After a nice couple of days, it meant that we left feeling stressed and deceived. A shame, given this was our fourth stay at the hotel.\n  \nThe location of the Le Apple Boutique Hotel @ KLCC is perfect - it's very easily walkable to the KLCC and Suria mall, as well as two other malls.\nThe check-in process was quick and easy.\nThe beds were comfortable and the room was spotlessly clean. The housekeeping service is excellent.\nWe requested a late check-out because of our late flight, and that was granted happily and with no extra charge, which was lovely and contributed to making our last day more pleasant.\nStayed in January 2019",8.3,BelindaBin,,,,,,,,,,,,

It seems undermanned.\n  \nLocation. The price should be okay if not for the stinky towels. I mean, the room itself was fine but to have towels that stink? Major turnoff. Still, I'd reiterate that the location is great.

Sometimes can smell cigarette odour in the room and corridor. It's really annoying and unfortunate to have a few disobedient guests polluting the whole floor and affecting everyone else.\n  \nStaff/Reception — Checking in and out were pretty smooth, quick, and hassle-free. The staff are very helpful and friendly and provide good customer service. They are well equipped with info and gladly assisted my parents who were inquiring about guided tours and deals, and were pleased with the details.\nRooms/Facilities — Stayed with a family of 5; king room for parents, triple room for me and siblings. Rooms were pretty spacious with comfy beds, decent air-conditioning, and reliable WiFi. Power sockets are available by the beds so you can charge your phones while using them in bed, and more charging points are by the desk. The view depends on the room; my room was facing the road with a nice view of the city centre, but other room was facing away from the road.\nBreakfast — It's a rather typical hotel buffet spread, with a little variation from day to day. Also a little Japanese touch with the sushi section and miso soup. Overall, it was satisfactory.\nLocation — Perfect! Conveniently a stone's throw away to the train station, making it easy to get around the city, and Avenue K Mall, which has a 7-11 and a supermarket (and didn't expect to find an Escape Room here called 'Breakout'. Go check it out, it's fun!). Also located just opposite Suria KLCC with plenty of dining and shopping outlets.

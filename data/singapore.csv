S1,R93,"Reviewed: April 1, 2019","  \nthe price is far to high for what was offered. room facilities and interior design are more like 3 to 4 star hotel. they give the room size 39 m2, it felt small. breakfast would be sing. dollar 50 extra! the pool was not what i expected, however the view is worth be seen. totally overcrowded like a childrens playground, nothing of a 5 star facility. you have to search for empty sun chair. could not find any nice restaurant in this hotel. all so packed and noisy, they did not let me choose a table of my taste in a bit more quiet area, which i did not like at all. so i did not eat in the hotel except room service which was nothing special. i would not choose this hotel again, as it is lacking atmosphere, service quality and style. for checkin and checkout you have to join long waiting lines.\n  \nthe view to the harbour view garden side was ok but below my expectations. it is better to book rooms with city view to see the lightshow in evening and the city skyline, this looks more interesting.\nStayed in March 2019",5.4,Christina,S2,9.141836735
S1,R91,"Reviewed: April 1, 2019","  \nBreakfast at Rise was comprehensive, but overpriced for the quality of food, still worth trying once. The entire hotel carries the feeling of a casino-centered resort, and if you're not into that vibe, it's probably not for you. That said, Singapore as a whole carries a similar sense of a place of red lines that must not be crossed, so the hotel property is not alone in the sense that one must always be aware of one's surroundings and their expectations. The hotel is far from Singapore's more pedestrian neighborhoods, so you'll be taking taxis often to experience local culture, bars, restaurants and such. The heat and humidity inspired my friend and I to reluctantly venture out, and it's clear that if you wish to experience ""Singapore"" you'll either need to stay somewhere more central or be more deliberate in your excursions. Mass transit stops underneath the hotel, so a motivated person can find relatively manageable access to the city's further regions. We did not try it in our short stay. 3 days in Singapore is enough, perhaps, to take in the salient points, but only if you venture forth from the resort. If you're looking to be pampered during a multi-day layover, though, this resort is probably the best on offer, but be prepared to pay handsomely. The mall is impressive, but impractical if you need a swimsuit, there are just two boutiques with swimwear and one of them has a tiny selection.\n  \nThe pool is as impressive as promised, though no one swims in it - its sole purpose seems to be an ""instagrammable"" experience, and that is evident by the constant churn of cameraphone wielding couples vying for space at the edge to capture the appearance of luck and good fortune. I'm guilty of the same. The staff were helpful, and I'm especially grateful to the room attendant for their attention to our comfort. The air conditioning is ample and delightful amounts of sunlight. The architecture and the atmosphere really do scream luxury and modernity, and there is no denying the impressive work done to create such a beautiful space.\nStayed in March 2019",7.5,Billie,S3,8.978571429

It was the last thing we wanted to do, to pack up and move.  After much urging, he agreed to get a co-worker to help him and they were able to get it back up on a temporary basis to at least last us till we checked out in the morning.  Also, all the plants on our balcony were dead.  Very odd.

S1,R39,"Reviewed: April 16, 2019","  \nWe had booked a family studio that had one king and two single beds. We were given an upgrade to an Orchid Suite on level 51 at checkin (nice touch) but told that it had a fold out sofa bed and an additional cot could be put in the room. All of that sounded fine, although crowded, which unfortunately it was. The fold out sofa bed however was completely substandard for a 5 star property. The mattress springs were pushing through and made it impossible to have a decent night sleep on. My Daughter ended up sleeping on the the sofa cushions “on top of the bed”. Given the rating of this hotel, this is unacceptable and, if nothing else, that bed should be replaced. \nFurther, the pool area needs better planning. It looks like a cheap Spanish holiday resort with customers reserving seats with towels for hours on end and General chaos everywhere.

S1,R32,"Reviewed: April 17, 2019","  \nEven though we had asked in writing beforehand, and then again at check-in, if we could use the pool after checking out, we were nearly unable to experience the pool. We had an evening flight and thought we’d enjoy the pool at the end of our stay. When we went to checkout, we were told using the pool was no longer available. The problem is that we had explicitly asked and been told we could turn in our room key for a temporary. The staff were insistent that we were mistaken and wouldn’t budge. They did offer an extra hour, 1/2 of which was wasted arguing. When we insisted on the manager viewing the CCTV tapes of our check-in, the tape was mysteriously missing and they finally offered us what had been promised. I would definitely stay at MBS again, but some of the staff could use a refresher on what customer service should look like.\n  \nMBS is such a beautiful place to stay, if you can afford it. The location, though not in the thick of things, is still very close and the MRT station underneath makes it easy enough to get wherever you need/want to go.

S1,R98,"Reviewed: March 30, 2019","  \nThe hotel was so huge that it felt pretty impersonal. The fact that there was no lobby or central point to the hotel contributed to this, as you came out of the lift and straight into the retail area. The staff at check in/out were perfectly polite and professional, but the whole set up lacked the warmth of most hotels. Maybe that's normal for this type of hotel.\nOn the day we checked out we had a really late flight. While there was a secure luggage facility, it was in a room outside the main building. In one way this made sense as it was conveniently next to the taxi rank, but on the other hand it very much felt that once you'd checked out the hotel wasn't interested any more. There were a couple of showers in the gym that you could use, and while these were nice there wasn't much room and they were miles from the luggage facility. As there was no lounge or lobby, there was nowhere to do that final bit of luggage juggling once you'd had your shower. For the money it cost to stay here, I'd have expected much more consideration and better facilities for guests with late flights.\nAlso, you can only use the rooftop pool until you check out - so if you have a late flight then you'll have to find something else to do. I can see that the hotel needs to do this as there are a lot of guests and the pool area was really busy, but it wasn't what I was expected and it was pretty disappointing.\n  \nThe view from our room was just breathtaking, and given this is why we wanted to stay here it didn't disappoint.\nThe infinity pool was awesome too, but very very busy. The beds are so close, and there are so many people who just go up to see the view and take photos that it felt hectic and transient rather than relaxing.

We treated ourselves, after a lot of deliberation, to three nights and Im glad to say I would definitely recommend it.\nThe room was huge (we had a king city view on the 30th floor) and the skyline view at night was stunning. The floor to ceiling windows allow you to just sit and watch the goings on outside and that alone felt really special. Of course it's all about the pool and it really is spectacular. An early morning or late evening swim is a very special experience and it's this that you're really paying the money for. You will remember it forever.\nThe hotel itself is in a perfect position and is linked to both the gardens by the bay on one side and the huge shopping centre/casino/harbour on the other. It is very well thought out and makes getting around an absolute breeze.\nIt isn't a glamorous, colonial, historic hotel like the Fullerton or Raffles so if you wanted something more that style then you'd be best looking elsewhere.

The shuttle services to and fro VivoCity are frequent, but not from Resort World Sentosa though. It is quite a long walk from RWS, for me, about 15-20min walk from Imbian Station. If choose to walk from Beach Station and through Palawan Beach, the walk takes more than 20mins too.\n  \nThe Property is really clean and cosy, and very comfortable! We booked a Premier Sea View room, and I stayed out at the balcony (with a view of the beach) for quite a few times during the stay, which was really quiet, good for a lazy and relaxing nap.\nThe customer service though, was a bit less than what I expected from a luxury hotel, and I felt there can be room for improvement. I had stayed during the Singapore public holiday long weekend, so I am not sure if this is due to the surge in visitors during this period.

At the gym, it's great to have technogym equipment but there are only 8 local channels, I expected at least some standard BBC or CNN channels. Also the faucets in the room and the facilities are sturdy but not easy to use, especially the water knobs are very hard to turn.

At checkout the explanation given was that there was an event on the second night, and the staff were up the whole night on our first night preparing for it. \nWhile my thoughts go out to the staff working late, this seems unacceptable for a hotel aimed at this segment - at least the singing on the second night was pleasant and ended relatively early at around 12-1am, but the furniture banging kept me up all night. Surely there must be some noise management policy in place...\n  \nIts not that the stay was poor perse, but at this price point, one can't be faulted for having much higher expectations.

In the allocated room, we could hear people slamming doors and couldn't sleep well for the 1st week as the sounds continued late into the night.

The newly allocated room was also a 2-bedroom suite, but slightly bigger. We switched on the air conditioning but the suite was hot and stuffy, so had to call the reception again.  A lady staff member came in to inspect and tried telling us that there was nothing wrong with the A.C  I requested that they call in a technician anyway.

The staff who showed us to our room did not know the rich history of the hotel which was formerly known as Beaufort Hotel, when asked, she merely said it has always been Sofitel. The corridor along the room 255 to 262 was soiled with animal poop, but no one cleared it away from the day we checked in to the day we checked out. Kids Club was miserably abandoned. On the 7th of September, when we finally found it after walking through the rain, the entrance seemed closed, so we asked a chef from the restaurant downstairs, he merely said the Kids Club was already closed because it is only open till 5 pm. Nonetheless, the time was only 4 pm when the conversation transpired. I gave the door a push, and it gave way, so we ventured up the stairway, which led us to the Kids Club. There was already a family consisting of a woman with 2 teenage children and 2 young children, who informed us that there had been no staff since they arrived. Left on their own, they helped themselves to all the glue balloons they could found in the drawers. My kids and I stayed till 6 pm and left the family still playing the video game in the Kids Club which they also helped themselves to. I have never encountered any reputable hotel who would not assign any staff to be in their Kids Club. This experience gave me a very bad impression of Sofitel, being an irresponsible hotel that seems to not have its best interests for its guests who are families with young children. More correct signages should be placed to properly direct guests to the Kids Club. Floor tiles leading to the lobby were all wet due to the rain, presenting themselves so slippery, it could have caused some mishaps.\n  \nThe hotel acceded to our request to decorate the room for our daughter's birthday.

The breakfast is limited and essentially what can be put out readymade, for eg only boiled eggs are offered in the Eggs Section and that too only twice a week. Also, no breakfast is served on Sat, Sun and public holidays and there aren't many options close by if you don't want to use your kitchenette. The seating in the breakfast area is also inadequate given the size of the hotel, particularly in busy season.\n  \nOPS' wonderful location is a huge advantage - parallel to the the central part of Orchard Road, less than a 5 min walk to the Orchard MRT station and a taxi stand opposite the property. The one-and-half bathrooms in our loft apartment were also a good convenience to have for our family of 3. The kitchenette is well equipped (but needs to have regular glasses as well).

The deck looks amazing online but was not nearly as impressive in person.  Food was OK; same with service (we would just walk up to the bar, which would then get the servers' attention).  \nFor an alleged 5-star hotel, some concierges were subpar; they used the Internet to give recommendations to popular restaurants, and said ""not possible"" to reasonable requests too many times.  Need clefs d'or.  \nTaxis refuse rides; I guess this happens in Singapore, but the doorman then allows the cabs to take others to destinations the cabs prefer and thus condones the scheme.

This is an absolute prime rooftop location for a bar, but they somehow managed to screw it up. The whole bar area has a “cafeteria” feeling (bad lighting at night). They also made it basically impossible to sit at the bar itself, something we enjoy quite a bit but that’s subjective. Finally, the food quality is simply unacceptable for a hotel/restaurant of this level.

I have stayed at The Raffles, some of the nice ones at Sentosa but The Fullerton Bay is the best. But it’s the best ONLY if you stay in the Bay/MBS view rooms. If you stay at the rooms by the side, then you might as well stay elsewhere. The view is what to stay for. The Fullerton Bay Hotel is ultra-luxurious but not Ultra-grand. The rooftop pool is a disappointment. For a hotel with such an incredible view, the rooftop pool area is very ordinary. There were a few family/couple pools by the side of the main pool that are actually private and far more fun as they’re almost like small infinity pools. The breakfast spread is wow but would say that flavour at the The Raffles breakfast was better for me. It was an incredible experience for my wife, 2 kids and me, but it’s best for a day staycation or 2 nights stay at most.\n  \nI have resided in Singapore for almost 5 years and have experienced other ultra luxurious hotels there and find The Fullerton Bay as Singapore’s best. It’s ultra luxurious, the interiors are a honeymooners/selfie-takers dream. And the view is unlike any other. The service standards are at par or better than the best in the world. Let me repeat this..... their service standards are at par or better than the best in the world. Located on the bay, offering the best view of the MBS, this hotel is THE place to stay in Singapore for anyone who is willing to spend what’s required. And if you cannot live here, do go here to dine/high tea and soak in the splendour. \nP.S. Loved the pasta sauce and the breakfast spread. High tea is a must have.

Firstly it means that you end up going up and down the stairs constantly. Secondly the design of the suites need more attention. In the living room on the lower level there is no electronic controller for the curtains. You have to walk upstairs to the bedroom to open the curtains from the bedside controller which is on the far side of the bedroom. This makes it difficult to access if you are watching TV.  The breakfast in the Town restaurant was just ok but not better than you'd find in any other hotel.

But that wasn't the case, my brother has went to request for as rider to pick them into my villa as they are quite a number of ppl i couldn't be picking them up at the lobby since they mentioned only once per call. Hence my brother have to make his own arrangement with the hotel staff, but that rude staff informed my brother that they can't arrange a buggy ride like this it is only for one-time usage per villa. Before she ends she even commented that she will do out of goodwill this time round for him as they could arrange only once for the buggy ride to pick them from lobby. Inconsistent of service.

The bins got emptied just once too. I left mine outside and was told by the cleaning staff to put it in the cute myself. The house rules need to be clearer. The tiles in the shower (floor) could have done with a scrub. It was uncomfortable that the bedside had lights and switches on just one side. If the microwave was on one had to unplug the switch. And there was no convenient place to keep the ironing board and plug the iron it  has a short cord. Not really practical to eat in - certainly not to cook in! I had no need to attempt it but don't come in expecting to. The counter is cluttered up and the little dining table across from the room.\n  \nThe staff were friendly.

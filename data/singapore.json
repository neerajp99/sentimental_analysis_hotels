We had an evening flight and thought we\u2019d enjoy the pool at the end of our stay. When we went to checkout, we were told using the pool was no longer available. The problem is that we had explicitly asked and been told we could turn in our room key for a temporary. The staff were insistent that we were mistaken and wouldn\u2019t budge. They did offer an extra hour, 1/2 of which was wasted arguing. When we insisted on the manager viewing the CCTV tapes of our check-in, the tape was mysteriously missing and they finally offered us what had been promised. I would definitely stay at MBS again, but some of the staff could use a refresher on what customer service should look like.\n  \nMBS is such a beautiful place to stay, if you can afford it. The location, though not in the thick of things, is still very close and the MRT station underneath makes it easy enough to get wherever you need/want to go. The Skypark and rooftop infinity pool are all you could hope for, the latter only accessible to guests. We had a club level room with a city view.

The fact that there was no lobby or central point to the hotel contributed to this, as you came out of the lift and straight into the retail area. The staff at check in/out were perfectly polite and professional, but the whole set up lacked the warmth of most hotels. Maybe that's normal for this type of hotel.\nOn the day we checked out we had a really late flight. While there was a secure luggage facility, it was in a room outside the main building. In one way this made sense as it was conveniently next to the taxi rank, but on the other hand it very much felt that once you'd checked out the hotel wasn't interested any more. There were a couple of showers in the gym that you could use, and while these were nice there wasn't much room and they were miles from the luggage facility. As there was no lounge or lobby, there was nowhere to do that final bit of luggage juggling once you'd had your shower. For the money it cost to stay here, I'd have expected much more consideration and better facilities for guests with late flights.\nAlso, you can only use the rooftop pool until you check out - so if you have a late flight then you'll have to find something else to do. I can see that the hotel needs to do this as there are a lot of guests and the pool area was really busy, but it wasn't what I was expected and it was pretty disappointing.\n  \nThe view from our room was just breathtaking, and given this is why we wanted to stay here it didn't disappoint.\nThe infinity pool was awesome too, but very very busy. The beds are so close, and there are so many people who just go up to see the view and take photos that it felt hectic and transient rather than relaxing.

An early morning or late evening swim is a very special experience and it's this that you're really paying the money for. You will remember it forever.\nThe hotel itself is in a perfect position and is linked to both the gardens by the bay on one side and the huge shopping centre/casino/harbour on the other. It is very well thought out and makes getting around an absolute breeze.\nIt isn't a glamorous, colonial, historic hotel like the Fullerton or Raffles so if you wanted something more that style then you'd be best looking elsewhere.

The entire hotel carries the feeling of a casino-centered resort, and if you're not into that vibe, it's probably not for you. That said, Singapore as a whole carries a similar sense of a place of red lines that must not be crossed, so the hotel property is not alone in the sense that one must always be aware of one's surroundings and their expectations. The hotel is far from Singapore's more pedestrian neighborhoods, so you'll be taking taxis often to experience local culture, bars, restaurants and such. The heat and humidity inspired my friend and I to reluctantly venture out, and it's clear that if you wish to experience \"Singapore\" you'll either need to stay somewhere more central or be more deliberate in your excursions. Mass transit stops underneath the hotel, so a motivated person can find relatively manageable access to the city's further regions. We did not try it in our short stay. 3 days in Singapore is enough, perhaps, to take in the salient points, but only if you venture forth from the resort. If you're looking to be pampered during a multi-day layover, though, this resort is probably the best on offer, but be prepared to pay handsomely. The mall is impressive, but impractical if you need a swimsuit, there are just two boutiques with swimwear and one of them has a tiny selection.\n  \nThe pool is as impressive as promised, though no one swims in it - its sole purpose seems to be an \"instagrammable\" experience, and that is evident by the constant churn of cameraphone wielding couples vying for space at the edge to capture the appearance of luck and good fortune. I'm guilty of the same. The staff were helpful, and I'm especially grateful to the room attendant for their attention to our comfort. The air conditioning is ample and delightful amounts of sunlight. The architecture and the atmosphere really do scream luxury and modernity, and there is no denying the impressive work done to create such a beautiful space.\nStayed in March 2019",

The worse of all is that we paid including breakfast but were notified at the hotel when we came that is does not include the weekend although this was not mentioned through booking and we paid the same rate for all seven nights. The answer that we got amazed us --- where their excuse was that they encourage by this the visitors to taste Singapore food outside the hotel.\nStayed in July 2017",

Secondly the design of the suites need more attention. In the living room on the lower level there is no electronic controller for the curtains. You have to walk upstairs to the bedroom to open the curtains from the bedside controller which is on the far side of the bedroom. This makes it difficult to access if you are watching TV.  The breakfast in the Town restaurant was just ok but not better than you'd find in any other hotel. The Straits Club closed at 7pm which seems too early.\n  \nThe hotel is a great use of an historic building. It's a grand property with the impressive atrium and two level suites.

I have stayed at The Raffles, some of the nice ones at Sentosa but The Fullerton Bay is the best. But it\u2019s the best ONLY if you stay in the Bay/MBS view rooms. If you stay at the rooms by the side, then you might as well stay elsewhere. The view is what to stay for. The Fullerton Bay Hotel is ultra-luxurious but not Ultra-grand. The rooftop pool is a disappointment. For a hotel with such an incredible view, the rooftop pool area is very ordinary. There were a few family/couple pools by the side of the main pool that are actually private and far more fun as they\u2019re almost like small infinity pools. The breakfast spread is wow but would say that flavour at the The Raffles breakfast was better for me. It was an incredible experience for my wife, 2 kids and me, but it\u2019s best for a day staycation or 2 nights stay at most.\n  \nI have resided in Singapore for almost 5 years and have experienced other ultra luxurious hotels there and find The Fullerton Bay as Singapore\u2019s best. It\u2019s ultra luxurious, the interiors are a honeymooners/selfie-takers dream. And the view is unlike any other. The service standards are at par or better than the best in the world. Let me repeat this..... their service standards are at par or better than the best in the world. Located on the bay, offering the best view of the MBS, this hotel is THE place to stay in Singapore for anyone who is willing to spend what\u2019s required. And if you cannot live here, do go here to dine/high tea and soak in the splendour. \nP.S. Loved the pasta sauce and the breakfast spread. High tea is a must have.

They provided a small shower and change room which we could use even after check out; this was very useful as we needed to leave back to the airport only by 5-6 pm but had to checkout by noon; so we could go around for our last day activities after check out, and then come back in the evening and freshen up (even have a bath) before leaving to the airport. The hotel's location at the Pier with the adjoining multiple eateries by the Pier staying open late meant that we could take a stroll out at night and get a lot of quick food choices for dinner.

It is very close to the Raffles MRT station so easy to access that transportation system to get around Singapore.  We found the staff to be very friendly and attentive and they made sure we had everything we needed during our stay. We chose a room with a view over the Marina which also gave us a balcony. The room itself was modern and very comfortable and we could not fault the facilities. We opted not to eat at the hotel other than breakfast but did make use of the very nice bar - The Lantern - which is on the roof next to the swimming pool. Would highly recommend this as a great place for a nightcap.\nLocation wise the hotel is within walking distance for the restaurant and bars of Boat Quay but to be honest, Singapore is pretty small so not a problem to get anywhere via the MTR or taxi.\nWe will definately be staying here again.\nStayed in March 2018",

Terrible experience at checkout when we asked for help with our baggage and waited over 30 minutes and no one turned up to the room, Eventually we carried all the luggage and Chris at front desk was so glued to his chair he couldn't get up to give us a hand.\nWhen we complained to Kim that our keys didn't work for days we were told with plenty of attitude that it was a faulty door and not a problem with the key (like it was our door- our fault). All we wanted was a functional key to get in rather than  keep coming to reception every time for help. This wasn't going to happen with Kim who was rather rude with plenty of attitude. We chose Shangri La apartments because of its good reputation but Kim and Chris made sure this wasn't the case. \n  \nNice place, shame about the staff\nStayed in October 2018",

The wife can pretty herself out there while the partner uses the bathroom!\nIf only the management has attended to these simple basic things, we would've given it an almost perfect score.\n  \nExcellent location; behind Orchard Rd; bus routes just outside on River Valley Rd and 10 min walking distance to MRT station either at Ft. Canning or Somerset (Orchard Rd). Free shuttle service from the Residence to either MRT stations in the morning.  This enabled us to go to the Changi airport via Fort Canning Downtown Line.\nExcellent reception service, 24 hrs a day.\nWe stayed in a Studio suite; spacious and cosy.  Very good storage faciilties in terms of  a whole wall of wardrobe and drawer space.  Just empty your suitcases and live like home!\nGood eating places on adjacent Killiney Rd - don't even have to cook.  NTUC supermarket nearby, 24 hrs if you need any provisions.\nThe free handy phone provided came in very useful.\nWe didn't use the gym or the swimming pool facilities but they did look clean and good.\nTwice a week cleaning was very good and that's all we need.  Can't stand the daily cleaning which hotels provide!\nAnd for us, a lovely Church of the Sacred Heart nearby on Tank Rd. (Also, a beautiful heritage listed Hindu temple on the same Rd if that's your religion)\nStayed in February 2019",

While there is supposed to be a personal assistant for each guest, I felt the service was still distant and mechanical, lacking a personal touch. We stayed for 2 nights, and for both there were loud noises late into the night at 1-2am - on the first night there was loud talking and banging of furniture till about 2am, and on the second night singing. At checkout the explanation given was that there was an event on the second night, and the staff were up the whole night on our first night preparing for it. \nWhile my thoughts go out to the staff working late, this seems unacceptable for a hotel aimed at this segment - at least the singing on the second night was pleasant and ended relatively early at around 12-1am, but the furniture banging kept me up all night. Surely there must be some noise management policy in place...\n  \nIts not that the stay was poor perse, but at this price point, one can't be faulted for having much higher expectations. The stay was a pleasant one on the whole, and I think one distinguishing point of Capella is the excellent amenities - from the complimentary minibar with Nespresso, soft drinks, juice and tea, to the Aesop toiletries, to complimentary free flow Aqua Panna by the poolside, to the afternoon tea in the Library.

It would be much appreciated if the check-in staff would point out our room locations on the map for us because the map found in the rooms only called out the heritage trees instead of stating the room numbers, so at the beginning we were a bit lost. I suppose a lot of guests might just watch programs on the internet, but having a family gathering in a 5-star establishment like this, I expected better TV channels and Video ( can be pay per view choices) in the living room for a movie evening. At the gym, it's great to have technogym equipment but there are only 8 local channels, I expected at least some standard BBC or CNN channels. Also the faucets in the room and the facilities are sturdy but not easy to use, especially the water knobs are very hard to turn.  Our 3-bedroom suites doesn't have the sea view like the picture in the description, our tree view is not bad, but sunlight is poor, so even during daytime, we need to have most lights on, I suppose those who wants a suite with sea view should definitely ask beforehand.\n  \nThe suites are spacious, clean and well equipped. Beds are very comfortable. The location is great. The fact that you can have 2 access points to the Palawan Beach is wonderful. The tier pools separating adult only and family with kids and one couple are a thoughtful design. Wi-fi without password in the whole establishment is very convenient.

Would be great if at least one restaurant (e.g. Knolls) can be accessible to pets as well. \nWas also a bit disappointed to realize that the breakfast did not have an in-room-dining option, since I stayed in a villa. For solo/couple travelers, an extra option of in-room breakfast for villas, for more privacy and exclusivity, would be greatly welcomed. The breakfast area at Knolls can get really crowded and noisy at peak hours, didn't enhance the experience of exclusivity that I was hoping to get at Capella. In this aspect, I feel that the dining experience did not match the exclusive price of the villas.\n  \nThe staff were all very polite and helpful.

The bathroom is very badly design as not enough hanging towels to hang our wet towels. The toilet was very smelly and could be the sewage problem or generally not well cleaned. The air conditioning in the room was not good as we can\u2019t possibly turn up n down the temperature. It maybe the thermostat problem which u are not able to adjust it properly. I think u must look at those 2 issues .\nStayed in February 2019",

There is no room dining service that would be really useful after a long day out. A vending machine for water, drinks somewhere at the reception and/or entrance lobby would be useful.\n  \nI like the setup and design of the apartment particularly the comfy beds, sofas and beautiful kitchen. The place is clean and quiet yet very close to the hustle of Scotts road. We appreciate the complimentary box of food and goodies left in the apartment. Although the breakfast was limited in variety, it was more than sufficient for us as a family to kickstart the day. My family really appreciate the attention provided by the staff to our needs and condition, as they waited for us due to our late arrival to the apartment and let us settle in quickly into our apartment and to only do the check in process the next day instead. Even the concierge went out of his way to wait with our bags for our ride to the airport outside the building in the heat, insisting that we just wait in the air-conditioned areas inside.\nStayed in March 2019",

The kitchen equipment is wholly inadequate for cooking anything more than a snack. The very low railings on the external corridors to the apartments make me suggest not visiting with young children. A lot of noise comes from nearby bars at night.

We were allocated a 2-bedroom suite as requested.  I had requested for a quiet room as I had my 87-year-old mum staying with me.  In the allocated room, we could hear people slamming doors and couldn't sleep well for the 1st week as the sounds continued late into the night.  Also the TV in the room was not working, so they called a technician to fix it. On requesting, they changed our room.  We packed our bags and moved.  On the same day we found technicians working on our room access key panel. We were informed that the panel was not working and that we will have to change our room again. The newly allocated room was also a 2-bedroom suite, but slightly bigger. We switched on the air conditioning but the suite was hot and stuffy, so had to call the reception again.  A lady staff member came in to inspect and tried telling us that there was nothing wrong with the A.C  I requested that they call in a technician anyway.  The technicians checked and found that they had to fix the A.C.  Thankfully it was fixed.  The other issue I had was with their housekeeping. They do not keep any spare toilet rolls.  We only ever had 1 roll in each bathroom.  When we were close to running out, we had to call the reception to ask for more rolls. The dish washing liquid bottle had minimum amount of soap and the rest was filled with water. The housekeeping staff forgot to keep a kitchen towel so we had to call Reception again.  The policy of the hotel management and staff is - what is the minimum we can do and get away with.  Not \u2013 what is the best we can do for our guests. If the guest does not complain, that is fine with them as it means the guest has learnt to put up with the issues.  Please do not have high expectations of this hotel.

The rain continued till the next morning, and our stay was rendered unenjoyable because we couldn't use the hotel facilities, neither could we have ventured out of the compound to enjoy the rest of what Sentosa has to offer. The staff who showed us to our room did not know the rich history of the hotel which was formerly known as Beaufort Hotel, when asked, she merely said it has always been Sofitel. The corridor along the room 255 to 262 was soiled with animal poop, but no one cleared it away from the day we checked in to the day we checked out. Kids Club was miserably abandoned. On the 7th of September, when we finally found it after walking through the rain, the entrance seemed closed, so we asked a chef from the restaurant downstairs, he merely said the Kids Club was already closed because it is only open till 5 pm. Nonetheless, the time was only 4 pm when the conversation transpired. I gave the door a push, and it gave way, so we ventured up the stairway, which led us to the Kids Club. There was already a family consisting of a woman with 2 teenage children and 2 young children, who informed us that there had been no staff since they arrived. Left on their own, they helped themselves to all the glue balloons they could found in the drawers. My kids and I stayed till 6 pm and left the family still playing the video game in the Kids Club which they also helped themselves to. I have never encountered any reputable hotel who would not assign any staff to be in their Kids Club. This experience gave me a very bad impression of Sofitel, being an irresponsible hotel that seems to not have its best interests for its guests who are families with young children. More correct signages should be placed to properly direct guests to the Kids Club. Floor tiles leading to the lobby were all wet due to the rain, presenting themselves so slippery, it could have caused some mishaps.\n  \nThe hotel acceded to our request to decorate the room for our daughter's birthday. The balloons were colourful and added fun to our otherwise boring room. The chocolate cake and marshmallows were a very pleasant surprise to our birthday girl.

The room was old, dirty, ragged, and showed signs of absolute stinginess. The next day we walk into the new room and there were cockroaches EVERYWHERE! We caught about 15 of them running around. It was horrifying. We called the host and asked him to switch us to another room. He said there were no rooms available. We ask for a refund and he refuses. When we insist he decides to show us two other rooms. The first one we walk into together and again there were tens of cockroaches just in front of the doorway. That's when he believes us. He takes us to another room, which thankfully had no cockroaches, but did have ants and smelled terrible. As we were tired and felt like there was no way to get our money back we decide to stay there. We couldn't wait until our time in KL ended so we could leave that place.

The wires were hanging out of the lamp on off button, the whole place needs a damn good scrub and a coat of paint. I had to use the hand shower over the bath as there was no way in hell I was going to get in that shower! It had a separate toilet room which stunk of urine and it never got cleaned once while I was there. I left little bits around the floors and carpets to see if they got cleaned, they didn't. From the photos on the booking page it looked an awesome place to stay, never again in this apartment! the location is brilliant and very central, but I would be too scared to book there again in case I got the same apartment! I even left a toaster I had purchased so I could have toast in the mornings, and also purchased cups, plates etc as there was no way I was going to use what was theirs. There was no safe in the room and the hair dryer was broken, the host said he would bring me one but never did, so had to get my hair washed and dried in the hairdressers in the shopping centre, over all very disappointed.

The TV remote control didn't have batteries so we had to go buy new batteries from the shop next door at midnight as the PIC did not have replacement batteries. But we were compensated in cash for buying it so no problem. The knob to plug the bathtub was not functioning well as we had to try a few times till it kinda worked but finally we gave up. I'm not sure if the hotel is a \"green\" hotel but guests were not allowed to smoke at the open/public area of the pool. They should allocate an area for smokers like us. They have a smoking area right outside the lobby anyways. We were told to stop smoking so we did. But, later on, there were other foreign guests that were happily smoking away without being scolded once. Not fair is it?\n  \nOverall it was a great experience and stay here. My partner was very pleased with the place, the food, the facilities, etc as it was his first time. Check in was fast and smooth and the PIC was helpful and nice. The minute we walked in the room, we already knew it was going to be a good experience. It was spacious, clean, tidy and did I mention spacious. The bed and pillow was soft and comfy. The bathroom was nice and big with a big bath tub (a plus for us ladies who wants to relax for a bit). The breakfast was RM47 nett (not inclusive in my room) but the spread was fairly good with a mix of local and western food. It was a good and reasonably priced breakfast as you can get about that price for a one-time american breakfast+drink outside. We then made our way to the pool. It was huge with a little slide for the kiddos to enjoy and a cute bar for the grown ups as well. A cafe is also available near the bar for when you need to much on some snacks. The sauna and jacuzzi in the toilet was big and working well. Was tempted to try it but I didn't have much time. Check out was short and sweet as well.

No reception at second building, you need to go back all the way to complain or to have a conversation with somebody regarding your issue. HK working only during day time, evening forget about it. Staff is unprofessional, might be they have some problem with communication. But in the end they was disturbing me.\n  \nLocation is good, this is the only one thing\nStayed in July 2018",

The property is the last building at your left. Is it called Frasier Residence and you will see in small letters 188 private suite. The \u201creception\u201d is however one building earlier. So you need to go inside at the reception and you have to mention that you want to check-inn for 188 prive suites. As you may reed in other reviews these rooms are rented buy a few quick guys which are not Malay. As you have to drag your suitcase again at the next building the will bring you to their check-in area. This is a room messy room with blankets everywhere and quite messy. After handling the financials we were given one of the rooms. They said that we would get our room in the next hour at 15:00 hours. If will spare you the frustration but it became 18:30 hours. The rooms where quite dirty. If you were white socks  the became dirty in no time. There is no cleaning, no change of bedlinen and no change of your towel. Even the toilet paper is not provided. So the facilities and room on it\u2019s own are great except the rest is not. There is no internet but that was mentioned at time of booking. If you put your chair at the door of the room you might pick up a free signal. If you would like to have some service, internet and nice people who actually can help you should book Frasier residence. But if you would like to go for the price and no service then I would recommend this accommodation. For us, if there is a next time, we will book Frasier.\n  \nThe room was very spacious. There is a swimming pool and  great fitness room with all modern equipment. The view of the fitness is great, because is it in the top floor. The metro is just 10 minutes away from the apartment.

The front desk staff, Alinus who was taking care of my check in gave me a room where somebody already checked in and was sleeping inside! This was the second case from him. Before me, while I was waiting to be check in, I saw him giving a room to a couple where somebody already checked in and with luggage inside the room! He explained it was the hotel system problem. I am not sure whether this is true. If it is, then apparently the hotel check in system has a very serious security flaw which the hotel management needs to look at it seriously. If it is the staff problem, I will suggest a re-training should be done asap.\nThe room is very clean. However, the hotel room windows are quite dirty, esp when the room is facing the Petronas Twin Tower, you would like to have a squeaky clean windows. A good clean up is due asap.\n  \nThe hotel is at a very good location. It is just opposite the Avenue K mall side entrance and diagonally opposite Robinsons Departmental Store and Suria KLCC mall. KLCC MRT station is just under Avenue K mall so commuting to the hotel from airport and around Kuala Lumpur is a breeze. The room is of good size, bigger than the Le Apple Boutique Hotel in Bukit Bintang.

Rooms were pretty spacious with comfy beds, decent air-conditioning, and reliable WiFi. Power sockets are available by the beds so you can charge your phones while using them in bed, and more charging points are by the desk. The view depends on the room; my room was facing the road with a nice view of the city centre, but other room was facing away from the road.\nBreakfast \u2014 It's a rather typical hotel buffet spread, with a little variation from day to day. Also a little Japanese touch with the sushi section and miso soup. Overall, it was satisfactory.\nLocation \u2014 Perfect!

So if you're in a group of people like us (6 people) then it could be an inconvenient thing. Although I don't know if you can get more cards cause we always went everywhere together so we didn't bother asking. If you can get multiple keys and cards then there is literally nothing to complain about.\n  \nCouldn't have been happier, if you see this place then you should definitely book it. I think it would be nearly impossible to find anything this nice in this price range. We payed 35USD a night.\nIt is very modern and spacious, it could easily our group of 6 people without any problems. They also have 3 AC units inside so you can always keep the temperature down in all the sleeping areas if you wish. It also comes with free parking and good service in general. The person we talked to was extremely helpful and always replied our messages within minutes. The room also had great view from the 23rd floor which was a nice bonus. Furthermore the building itself is connected to the train station so it is very convenient if you don't have a car and don't want to spend money on a Taxi.\nWe did have to pay a 300RNG deposit beforehand in case of any damages but we got it back just a few hours after we checked out via bank transfer. It was very quick and simple.\nWe will definitely be staying here next time we go KL.\nStayed in November 2018",

Only 1 tissue box in the bathroom.. seriously? No counter top for us to work on either except a round l breakfast table in room.

The spa closes at 10pm and i remembered i was the last client leaving the area (around 9:30pm).  When i figured out, 2 days later, of my oversight, i contacted both the reception and the hotel SPA staff but they said they didnt find anything!! How is it possible that in a Five star hotel like Sheraton, you can not find an item or a clothing that you forgot in a private space, all the more, since nobody appart from the staff would enter this place after you??!!! Imagine if i had forgotten my cell phone in the restaurant or elsewhere? This is an unsecured place! Besides, the most disapointing thing after that, was how my complain to the hotel has been treated:\n- complete disregard and detachment from the hotel manager (M. Derreck), who sent me a whatsapp message 3days after i left the city to say they could not find the item\n- total arrogance from one particular person in the hotel staff (M.Fairouz) who shouted at me over the phone when i was saying my disapointment regarding the situation!\nSo let me just say a simple message to the hotel staff management: Shame on you! Shame on you that you are not professionnal and you are tarnishing the image and values of the sheraton brand and chain!\nAs a former regular customer of the sheraton brand around the world and a starwood member, i feel really bad for your behaviour and would never book again in one of your hotels.

The agent (Not Local) was not happy upon arriving to our room. We showed him around and requested for a change to another room.  He was very reluctant to assist and kept passing remarks on us. \"If the next room same condition, we are not allow to change again\".  We felt threaten by his statement.  Without further delay, 3 of my friends followed him to the new room that was highly recommended by him to confirm on the condition esp the washroom doors. To our disappointment, the room was also not well maintain and the kettle condition is still the same condition as the previous room. We called for a replacement of the water kettle as we have given up on them.  FYI the bathtub was also not working well.  The water remains in the bathtub for 3 days. We used it to wash our legs only. There is alot of grievances during our stays.  Nevertheless, this suite is not highly recommended to stay and we will not be recommending any of our friends. They should do something about their room condition and their service render. This is totally different environment from my previous stays with Berjaya Times Sq Hotel.

I communicated over two months back and got a confirmation about me and my friends getting a early checking and a late checkout. specially a early check in. and I even got a email from booking.com saying that the agent has approved and confirmed a early check-in with a welcome drink etc.. But the welcome we received was horrible and very unpleasant. The agent had no idea that we had a early check in and point blank refused to give us an apartment. after a lot of fuss they put us into a used/unclean apartment to rest and keep our bags. The apartment was smelling of smoke and non of us wanted to rest or even be in there, hence we went out to the mall. (so we arrived at the location at 7am and was taken to the dirty apartment at 9am) we had to sit out of the mall until it opened at 10am. and was there till until the agent gave the apartment at 1pm. This caused a huge delay in our plan as we were all tired traveling after work and been in the airports for over 5 hours etc, to come to the place we paid for and not get the service we expected, all we simply wanted was to settle down, have a shower, rest and get on with our plans.. but the start of the trip was crap and that messes all our plans and delayed the rest of the plans. I have always gone through booking.com from year 2009 but this was the worse experience I ever had to face.. They really lacked coordination... you all need to deliver what you promise your guests.. my friend had booked another apartment under a different agent and he had absolutely no issues.. If the property declined my request of a early check in I was planning to book a room from 6am to 2pm for me and my friends to freshen up and rest. unfortunately I couldn't do that cz I got a confirmation saying my request was approved.. I also complained about a light not working in the washroom and that was never fixed.\n  \nI love the location and the space of the apartment.\nStayed in October 2018",

It seems to not be sure whether it is a family focused hotel or a design hotel, but it doesn't fit comfortably into either category. The price seems to reflect the idea of it being some kind of design hotel but the rooms just don't meet the mark and it works out a whole 100RM more expensive than other places in the city I've stayed, which were far more luxurious and comfortable. In fairness, being near the station bumps up the price a little, but still- I wouldn't choose it again over others in the city.\n  \nThe staff are all very well trained and go out of their way to help- especially the front desk and concierge staff.

One has to log in and out every few minutes\n- The view from the rooftop was noting like on the pictures. Nonetheless after a long day in the heat a swimming pool is always a plus\n- Breakfast which as we saw by other reviews was supposed to be great, was actually a disappointment. Something was missing all the time and due to the amount of people you had to wait for food for ages. Food itself was not very good either. \nTo sum up it\u2019s a cheap, quite clean place to stay in Bangkok, where you can rest. Don\u2019t expect too much :) \nStayed in February 2019",

We particularly liked the duty manager (mes) she was so cute and we said hello to her everyday. She gave us good recommendations on places to eat and was just a generally lovely person. The breakfast was very good and of high standard. We would def stay here again and rated this 5* .. also l would like to comment on how amazing the service was on ground floor at concierge. When we arrived they took our bags and delivered to our room. Every morning they said hello and was always there to help you. Always smiling. I cannot believe how good this experience overall was.

Totally no view from the balcony, but given the location, maybe it is for the best. We chose the hotel for its closeness to the airport link, but it turned out a real challenge to get there. Google gives the route vie the previous stop, and then after you have to go 700 meters via the railway which is totally unsuitable for suitcases. At the hotel we understood that the closest station is actually the last/first one, but you have to go pass the next building back yard - again not good for suitcases rolling, but at least the distance is much shorter. The small streets around the hotel are terrible, but full with hotels, so I guess this is normal.\n  \nThe hotel is reasonably good. We had fast check-in and the front-desk officers were nice and English speaking. The room was good and clean, although the bathroom could have been cleaner.  At least Tarawish offers some free buggy drive to the civilization :) Shopping malls and public transportation points are really close.\nStayed in January 2018",

Additionally, I found breakfast to be a little bit limited and would definitely ask the administration to add at least a few varieties of tea :)\nFinally, may I suggest to add little notes to the rooms about changing towels: although it is incredibly nice of them to change them daily, there is no actual need for it and it would save the environment if only those towels that need changing were changed (i.e. those left on the floor as a signal, as is done in many hotels these days).\n  \nThe design of the hotel is very nice, everything was extremely clean (towels changed daily, very tidy and neat everywhere), staff are very helpful, nice and answer all your questions. They let me check in several hours early, even though I just wanted to drop my bag and use the WiFi for some time :)\nThe rooms are spacious and bright, shower very convenient and clean. There is a kettle in the room, as well as a hair dryer, so very convenient. There are also several plugs, so you can charge all your devices simultaneously.\nGetting to the hotel can be a bit sketchy, but it is very close to the Siam area with tons of shops, markets and street food, and night life. \nOverall, it was a great stay!\nStayed in January 2018",

I would strongly suggest to write down \"please be quiet and respect the other guests\" in their house (and employees) rules as a reminder for those who forget that's a hotel and most people stay there to get some rest!\nBreakfast was nothing really special but coffee was just plain bad.\nBe aware they ask for deposit at check-in, we stayed one night and they asked for 1000THB. They do return it upon checkout, but why on Earth would a hotel require a deposit when the guests booked via Booking.com?\n  \nLocation (though super close to Phaya Thai ARL, can get a bit confusing to reach). Hotel is new, apparently 1 year old only. Room and bathroom were beautiful, modern and very clean. We had quite a nice view of Bayoke 2 tower from our room on the 8the floor. \nOverall good value for money but we just we're probably very unlucky with a floor full of party-going unrespectful Chinese youngsters.\nStayed in November 2018",

But they had been sending me annoying emails like my card isn\u2019t working. So my booking was not confirmed . It was kind of weird because I had been using my card in Malaysia at the same time. But I can understand that, the worst part is when I arrived hotel and checked in (at 1pm). It gave me old vibes, the furnitures, decoration are so old. It was not the same as in those pictures they have been showing on online. It was a kind of crappy room. The bathroom seems like old and dirty. The lights were not working as well (except the lamb beside the bed). My room was all dark and it kind of gave me creepy vibe. I couldn\u2019t stay in that room and felt really really uncomfortable. So I decided to checked out at 8pm. And then I told a staff at the reception, she asked me to pay for the another day, she said I already booked for two days. I was like what the hell! They had been sending me those emails that my booking was not confirmed and now I had to pay for another day that I won\u2019t stay for sure. But I was really tired and exhausted at that time, I paid for it (it was like 7/8 hours stay at the crappy hotel \ud83d\ude02). And that receptionist couldn\u2019t speak proper English, was impatient and rude. So if you\u2019re considering to stay, this hotel might be worth avoiding. \nStayed in July 2018",

I checked my whiskey and it has obviously been previously opened, filled with god knows what and there was a very poor attempt to reseal the bottles.

Avoid Tuk tuks from outside the hotel- very extortionate. Easy to get to Siam discovery or bmt mall from here. The rooms were huge.

First of all, the location of the hotel is probably the most dirty place in Bangkok. Nana Plaza is only a brothel, where European male travellers go find female company. It's a place of dirty streets, vomitting drunken people, pickpocketers, belligerent individuals and beggars.. On the balcony door of the hotel, there is a warning sign: always lock the door before leaving your room. When you go out onto the swimming pool area, you will see 70-year old European seniors, accompanied by underaged Thai girl, bathing into the very cold water. \nBreakfast is not included in the price of the accommodation / despite the assurance of booking.com/. Moreover, when you decide to go for it, it is ridiculously insufficient and expensive. And you are even charged another 10percent for \"service fee\".\nOutside, there is a skyscraper under construction, a power generator and loud-mouth guests, who walk through the central corridors all night long. So it's impossible to have a good rest.\nTo conclude, this hotel seems to tolerate the admission of prostitutes inside its premises, because at the reception desk we were warned that the price for a\" guest visit\" into our room will be charged additionally.\n  \nThe cleaning lady and the door man were very polite\nStayed in February 2018",
